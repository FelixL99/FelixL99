Hello!

My name is Felix Lindgren and I'm an Media Technology student at Link√∂ping University. This is a profile I use to keep track of anything from projects to labs.

I hope that you'll find the code here interesting or helpful, depending on why you are looking at it.

If you are interested in looking at projects I have been apart of but don't own the repository to, feel free to look at the following:

TNM096 - Artificial Intelligence (2021): https://github.com/JohnnyElmer/TNM096

TNM085 - Modelleringsprojekt (2021): https://github.com/jennyrudemo/NewtonsCradle

TNM089 - Imaging Technology (2022): https://github.com/JohnnyElmer/TNM089-Focus

P.s. Do take into account that since I was only a part of each group I cannot promise that I understand all parts of the code or even remember exactly what it was I did on each particular one. It is also important to be aware that I am Swedish and some of these projects are primarily or partly done in Swedish, I simply chose to keep all introductions etc on GitHub in English as I am fluent in it and want English speakers to be able understand everything.
